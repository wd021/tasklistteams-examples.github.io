<h5>
TaskList is a task manager for your Microsoft Teams team. Here's a guide on how to use it. Every team member has access to the same commands.
</h5>

## Add Tasks

Use **`task`** to add a task. Add **`#tags`** to categorize them.

```examples
task Discuss new design plans! #design #demo
task Prepare for tokyo event #meetings
```

?>&bull; If you create a task with no tags, it will automatically be assigned to **#all**.

## View Tasks

Use **`list`** to view a list of all your tags.

```examples
list
```

Use **`list #tag`** to view tasks for a specific tag.

```examples
list #meetings
list #design
```
